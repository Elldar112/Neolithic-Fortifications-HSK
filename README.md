**Fortifications - Neolithic** rebalanced for **Hardcore SK**.

**This is a standalone version of the mod.** But You can also grab the patch alone from Patches folder if You prefer to use workshop version.

Changes: ⁨
- Material/Research conversion
- Architect Sense Support
- Reduced HP of pallisade structures so they are weaker than stone walls
- Integration with Vile's Pre-Industrial if it's active.
